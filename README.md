# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is the process of creating simple, visual representations of a web page or application's layout and structure. These wireframes are typically low-fidelity sketches or digital outlines that focus on the placement of elements, navigation, and user flow, without detailing colors, graphics, or final content.

## Importance in the Design Process

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process because it allows designers, developers, and stakeholders to:

- Visualize the basic structure and functionality of a product before investing time in detailed design and development.
- Identify potential usability issues early and make quick adjustments.
- Facilitate clear communication and collaboration among team members.
- Ensure that user needs and business goals are addressed from the outset.

By starting with wireframes, teams can iterate rapidly and build a strong foundation for successful, user-centered products.
